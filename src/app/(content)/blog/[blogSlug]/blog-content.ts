    content: `# Career Guidance: Your Path to Clarity, Confidence, and Informed Decisions

Choosing a career path is one of the most important decisions we make in life, and that&apos;s exactly why it can feel overwhelming. Whether you&apos;re a student exploring career options, a young professional seeking growth, or someone considering a career transition, the path ahead can be full of uncertainty.

This is where **career guidance** comes in offering clarity, confidence, and direction. In this blog, we&apos;ll explore what **career guidance** is, why it&apos;s essential, and who can benefit from it. We&apos;ll also debunk some common misconceptions to ensure you&apos;re equipped with the right knowledge to take charge of your future.

# What is Career Guidance?

Career guidance is a process where trained professionals help individuals identify their strengths and interests through self-assessments, enabling them to make informed career decisions.

## In a nutshell, Career guidance focuses on

- Identifying individual interests.
- Exploring career paths that align with the identified individual interests.

# A Brief History of Career Guidance

The concept of career guidance is not new, it has been around for over a century. Let&apos;s take a look at how it started and evolved!

- **Early 1900s:** Career guidance emerged during the World Wars when returning veterans and displaced workers struggled to reintegrate into civilian life. To address this, governments and organizations developed vocational programs, paving the way for modern career counselling. Frank Parsons, known as the "father of vocational guidance," introduced a structured approach to career decision-making based on:
  - Self-assessments (Personality, Vocational Interests and Preferences)
  - Labour market trends (Understanding occupations & required skills)
- **Mid-20th Century:** Career counselling expanded into educational institutions, helping students align their interests with growing job opportunities.
- **Present Day:** With advancements in psychology, technology, **career guidance assessment tests**, personalized coaching, and AI-driven tools, **career guidance and counselling** blend traditional expertise with modern tools to ensure personalized career support.

# Why is Career Guidance Important? How does it matter?

In an era of rapid technological change and evolving job markets, making the right career choice is more complex than ever. **Career guidance** plays a vital role in helping individuals:

- **Gain Clarity** – Understand personal strengths and aspirations.
- **Make Informed Decisions** – Explore various career paths with expert insights.
- **Boost Confidence** – Reduce uncertainty and gain confidence.

# Who Can Benefit from Career Guidance? Is it just for students?

**No! Career guidance is for everyone.** No matter where you are in your professional journey, expert guidance can help you take the right step forward, here&apos;s how:

- **Students** – Choosing the right subjects, courses, or career paths can be overwhelming. **Career guidance for students** provides clarity and direction.
- **Young Professionals** – Those early in their careers can discover growth opportunities and develop skills for long-term success.
- **Mid-Career Professionals** – If you&apos;re feeling stuck or considering a career change, guidance can help you realign with your passions.
- **Anyone Facing Career Uncertainty** – Whether re-entering the workforce or unsure about the next step, expert advice helps you move forward with confidence.

# Myth Busting

While we are understanding Career Guidance in this blog, let&apos;s also clear some common misconceptions about Career Guidance

### **Myth #1: Career Guidance is Only for Students**
**Reality:** While **career guidance for students** is essential, career planning is a lifelong process. Professionals at any stage can benefit from expert guidance.

### **Myth #2: A Career Guidance Assessment Test Predicts Your Future**
**Reality:** No test can decide your career for you. However, a **career guidance assessment test** helps identify your strengths, interests, and possible career paths.

### **Myth #3: Career Guidance is the Same as Job Placement**
**Reality: Career guidance and counselling** focus on long-term career development, not just landing a job. It helps individuals build fulfilling careers, not just find employment.

# Take Charge of Your Career Today

The journey to a fulfilling career starts with the right guidance. Whether you&apos;re a student, a professional, or someone seeking change, **career guidance** can provide clarity, confidence, and a roadmap for success.

# Career Coaching vs Career Counselling:

Your career journey is ever growing and ongoing etc whether you&apos;re a student exploring possibilities or a professional striving for the next milestone. Choosing the right guidance can make all the difference. Understanding the distinction between career counseling and career coaching helps you make informed decisions that shape your future. In this blog, we&apos;ll explore their origins, key differences, and how choosing the right support can significantly impact your career trajectory.

# Origins of Counselling

The [roots](https://www.newyorkbehavioralhealth.com/history-of-mental-health-counseling-part-i/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) of counselling can be traced back to the early 20th century. Frank Parsons, often hailed as the "father of vocational guidance," established the Bureau of Vocational Guidance in Boston. His mission was to assist individuals in aligning their personal traits with suitable careers. This pioneering work laid the foundation for modern **career counselling** practices and continues to influence how we approach career guidance today.

As the field evolved, traditional **career counselling online** began offering accessible and empathetic support, making it easier for individuals from all backgrounds to explore their options and make decisions about their futures.

# The Rise of Coaching

In contrast to the early days of counselling, [coaching](http://thetimes.co.uk/) emerged as a distinct profession in the latter half of the 20th century. Drawing inspiration from sports and business, coaching focuses on enhancing performance and realizing capability . The development of models such as the GROW model in 1986 exemplifies the structured approach that **Career coaching brings** to personal and professional development.

This evolution has also given rise to **personal and professional coaching** methods that empower individuals to set clear goals, overcome challenges, and achieve significant milestones. With a proactive and action-oriented mindset, career coaching emphasizes forward movement, making it an essential tool for those who want to take charge of their professional lives.

# Understanding Career Counselling

**Career counselling** is designed to provide guidance by helping you understand and navigate your career options. This process often includes assessments to evaluate your interests, skills, and values, advising you toward a career path that aligns with who you are. Whether you&apos;re considering a new field or trying to clarify your current direction, **career counselling online** platforms offer insights and support tailored to your unique situation.

By connecting with a career counsellor, you can expect a compassionate, clear, and inclusive approach that not only illuminates your strengths but also helps you envision a fulfilling future.

# The Power of Career Coaching

On the other hand, **Career coaching** is a dynamic, collaborative process focused on empowering you to achieve specific professional goals. Unlike the reflective nature of counselling, coaching is action-oriented—geared toward setting objectives, developing strategies, and building essential skills such as leadership, communication, and resilience.

A career coach works with you to break down long-term goals into manageable steps, fostering both skill development and self-confidence. Through regular check-ins and strategic planning, **Career coaching** helps you stay motivated and accountable as you navigate the evolving job market. This approach not only encourages growth but also cultivates a sense of community and connection, as you&apos;re guided by professionals who understand your challenges and are eager to help you succeed.

# Key Differences and Their Impact

## Focus and Approach

- **Career Counselling:** Emphasizes understanding your personal interests, values, and skills to identify career paths. This process is often reflective and analytical, designed to decide which direction to choose.
- **Career Coaching:** Is future-focused and action-oriented, prioritizing goal setting and the development of strategies to overcome specific challenges. It is designed to drive progress and encourage continuous improvement and helps you identify the suitable career.

## Duration and Outcome

- **Career Counselling:** Typically involves a shorter, more focused engagement aimed at providing clarity and suggesting you to make decisions. Whether you opt for face-to-face sessions or **career counselling online**, the goal is to set a solid foundation for your professional journey.
- **Career Coaching:** Often represents a longer-term commitment. As you work together with your coach, you receive ongoing support and accountability, ensuring that your strategies adapt to a changing job market and that your growth is sustained over time.

## Action-Oriented Growth

The beauty of **Career coaching** lies in its ability to inspire action. By focusing on tangible steps and measurable outcomes, coaching not only improves your professional skills but also boosts your confidence. This dynamic approach can be especially beneficial in today&apos;s fast-paced world, where adapting quickly and maintaining momentum are key to long-term success.

# Bringing It All Together

Whether you choose **career counselling online** for its accessibility or decide that the structured, ongoing support of **Career coaching** is the right fit for you, remember that both pathways are designed to empower you. Embrace the guidance available, take confident steps toward your dreams, and join a community committed to helping you realize your full capability.

Your journey is unique, and the right guidance can make all the difference. Explore [**our story**](https://www.inwesol.com/story) and see how we&apos;re making a difference!"

    content: `# Why Knowing Your 'Why' Matters in Career Wellbeing

Purpose is an active commitment to accomplish an aim that is both meaningful to the self and of consequence to the world beyond the self. 

Have you ever felt like you're working hard but still feel disconnected from what you do? Or maybe you've switched careers, chased better salaries, or followed the path everyone recommended, yet something still feels off. That “something” could be the missing piece , your “why”. 

When you discover your purpose \- your reason for doing what you do, your career takes a different shape. It becomes something that energizes you, aligns with your values, and offers more than just a paycheck. It gives you direction, resilience, and clarity.

This is the core of career wellbeing

# So, What Is Career Wellbeing?

Career Well Being refers to the fulfillment individuals feel in their everyday work. It is at its peak when their work aligns with their strengths, offers a sense of purpose, and keeps them deeply engaged.

According to Gallup, career wellbeing is one of the five essential elements of overall well being, and it influences everything from your mental health to your physical health and even your relationships. When people experience purpose at work, research shows they are more engaged, more productive, and even healthier.

# How Do You Know Your ‘Why’?

For many of us, discovering our ‘why’ doesn’t happen overnight. It’s often a journey. There are a few different ways people tend to find their sense of purpose:

1\. **Proactive Exploration**    
Some people actively seek it. They reflect on their strengths, explore their interests, and ask themselves meaningful questions about what they want to contribute to the world. This kind of self-discovery is an intentional and reflective process.

2\. **Reactive Moments**    
For others, purpose emerges from experiences, sometimes difficult ones. A setback, a life-changing event, or even dissatisfaction with a current career path might lead to deep self-questioning, which sparks the need for change.

3\. **Social Learning**    
Sometimes, purpose is shaped by our surroundings. Role models, communities, or causes we care about can influence what we choose to pursue. The values of people around us often shape our own.

Let’s see some stories on.. How Purpose Drove Individuals Towards Excellence

### **Story #1: The Dancer Who Refused to Stop**

Sudha Chandran, She started dancing at the age of three, and it wasn’t just a hobby, it was her identity. Despite societal pressure to follow a “safe” path, she followed her passion. But at sixteen, she met with a terrible accident that resulted in the loss of a leg. For most, that would have been the end of the story, but not for her. With a Jaipur foot and unshakable belief, she learned to dance again. She performed on national stages and starred in films. Her purpose gave her strength and a reason to rise again.This story is the best example of how both proactive efforts and reactive moments came together to shape her purpose.

### **Story #2: The Inventor Who Changed His Village**

Mallesham, a young man from a rural village, watched his mother suffer daily due to the tedious hand-weaving process. Her pain moved him deeply. Without any technical background, he set out to build a machine that could ease her work. Everyone doubted him. But he persisted, working for years to build what later became the **Lakshmi Asu machine**. His invention revolutionized traditional weaving and earned him national recognition. His story shows how empathy sparked his purpose, and how both reactive moments and proactive efforts helped him create a machine that truly made a difference. 

### **Story #3: Murlikant Petkar** 

India’s first Paralympic gold medalist, Murlikant Petkar was once a soldier who was severely injured during the 1965 war. Despite the physical challenges, he didn’t stop. He turned to swimming and eventually represented India, winning a gold medal in the 1972 paralympics. Even before his injury, he had a strong inclination toward sports, from wrestling at a young age to becoming a boxer in the army and winning a silver medal in Tokyo, Petkar consistently pursued **excellence**. He was always in search of becoming the **best version of himself**, driven by curiosity, discipline, and a deep love for sport. This proactive journey shows how purpose can be self-driven,  shaped by one’s own choices, values, and efforts to contribute meaningfully to the world. 

These are just a few examples. Each story is different, yet one thing connects them , a strong sense of purpose.

When your career aligns with your purpose, it creates:

1\. **Clarity:** You know what you’re working toward and why it matters.    
2\. **Perseverance**: Continued effort to do or achieve something despite difficulties or failures.    
3\. **Resilience**: The ability to bounce back from setbacks.    
4\. **Improved mental health and career wellbeing**: You feel more fulfilled, less stressed, and more confident about your choices.

Here’s how a coach can help you connect with what truly matters to you?

Many times, we get stuck because we haven’t paused to reflect. We chase jobs, promotions, or trends, but forget to ask what really matters to us. That’s where coaching helps. With the right coach, you gain a safe space to explore your values, interests, and goals. You start recognizing patterns in your choices, understanding your strengths, and gradually finding clarity about your next steps. Whether you're just starting out, switching careers, or feeling lost in the noise, discovering your why can help you move forward with confidence.

    content: `# Self-Discovery: The Foundation of a Meaningful Career

Imagine graduating from one of the most prestigious engineering institutes in the country. You have the grades, the reputation, and a degree from a top tier college. But deep down, you are still not sure about what to do, you feel confused and lost: your heart isn’t in the degree you have.

This was the reality for Raj and many like him. A bright student whose passion lay in one subject, yet enrolled in another subject simply because of the college’s brand and reputation. After graduation, he found himself back in square 1, directionless in life. Eventually, he stumbled into a consulting role and started his career, completely unrelated to his education.

Raj’s story isn’t unique. It’s the story of countless individuals who follow society’s expectations like college prestige, peer influence, or parental advice, only to discover their strengths and interests lie elsewhere. If only we pause and take a step back from these external pressures to focus on what truly resonates with us, we can make career choices that feel purposeful and fulfilling.

# The Cost of Ignoring Your Inner Compass

When we choose a path based solely on reputation or safety, we risk ending up in roles where we lack genuine motivation. The result? A career with no satisfaction, limited growth, and eventual burnout. Even research shows that employees who align their work with natural strengths are more engaged, productive, and satisfied. By neglecting the crucial journey of self-discovery, we lose the chance to tap into our unique capabilities.

# Why Self-Discovery Must Come First

1. **Clarity Over Confusion:** Understanding your interests and strengths cuts through the noise of “trendy” courses or high-salary roles. You’ll know which opportunities are truly worth pursuing.  
2. **Purposeful Goal-Setting:** When you know your "why," your goals become more than checkpoints. They’re stepping stones toward a career that matters to you.  
3. **Resilience in the Face of Change:** Markets shift, technologies evolve, and industries transform. A deep self-awareness helps you adapt, pivot, and thrive no matter what comes your way.  
4. **Confidence in Decision-Making:** Decisions grounded in personal insight are more confident and less prone to second-guessing.

# The Self-Discovery Journey: Your First Steps

- **Reflect:** Spend time to understand your interests, values, and natural talents. What activities energize you? What activities make you lose track of time?  
- **Explore:** Take aptitude tests, personality assessments and meet career coaches for further exploration.  
- **Connect:** Reach out to potential mentors who mirror your aspirations. Their guidance can open up you to a whole new avenue of possibilities.

# Making Informed, Purposeful Career Choices

By embracing self-discovery, you...

- Transform the overwhelming task of career selection into a meaningful expedition.  
- Shift through options with a clear filter, recognizing which roles align with your core.

Whether you’re a high school graduate, a college student, or a working professional, this process is your secret weapon.

# Your Next Chapter Begins with You

At Inwesol, we believe every career journey should start from within. Our tools, one-on-one coaching programs are designed to help you uncover your unique strengths and capabilities so you can make decisions that feel right and lead to fulfilling choices.

**Choosing a career is one of the most important decisions a person will ever make.**
For intermediate students, typically teenagers , this decision may seem overwhelming. But this phase is actually a great time to start exploring possibilities. Why? Because building self-awareness early leads to more confident, informed decisions later.

At **Inwesol**, we believe that every career journey should begin with understanding yourself. This blog shares 6 simple yet powerful self-reflective activities that can help students start their career discovery with clarity, curiosity, and confidence.

![Career Exploration Funnel](/career-exploration-funnel.jpg)

#  1. Start with Self-Assessment Questionnaires
Imagine having a mirror that doesn’t just reflect your appearance, but your personality, interests, and capability. That’s what self-assessment tools do.
Tools like:
- **Career readiness** : Career maturity Test refers to your readiness to make informed career decisions based on awareness, information-seeking, confidence, and effective use of resources. Click here to take right now 
- **Interests** : RIASEC (Holland Code ),  Matches your interests with real-world careers and work preferences.
- **Personality** : Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) Helps you understand your personality, how you think, feel, and behave.It also offers insights into how you work, communicate, and make decisions
- **Skill test** : Careers are not just about what you like, they’re also about what you’re good at. List down like:
  - **Hard skills:** Writing, coding, designing, math, drawing.
  - **Soft skills:** Listening, teamwork, leadership, empathy.

These assessments don’t give you a final answer, but they act like a mirror, reflecting your own interests and what feels natural and energising to you.

# 2. Reflect through Journaling

Your thoughts and feelings are important indicators of what excites you.

Maintain a **career journal** where you write:
- What subjects or activities make you feel good?
- What do you enjoy doing when you have free time?
- What kind of problems do you love solving?
- Who or what inspires you?

This simple habit can highlight underlying patterns. Over time, you’ll start to notice the threads that connect your passions, values, and potential career choices.

📝 **Tip:** Journal weekly, even if it’s just a few lines. Reflection grows with repetition.

# 3. Research and Explore Careers
## A. Online Activities
Once you know what excites you, explore careers that match those interests.

Use websites like:
- **India’s National Career Service (NCS)**
- **My Next Move (US-based but useful)**
- **Inwesol’s Career Explorer (coming soon!)**

Look into:
- What subjects should you study?
- How does the career grow over time?
- What kind of people thrive in it?
- What does a day in that job look like?

Research turns vague dreams into real possibilities.

## B. Conduct Informational Interviews (Offline)
No website can replace a real conversation.

Talk to someone who already works in the field you’re curious about. It could be a family friend, neighbor, teacher, or someone from your extended network. Ask them:
- What do they love about their work?
- What’s challenging?
- What should students know if they want to enter this field?

These chats are eye-opening. You’ll learn what textbooks can’t teach.

📝 **Tip:** Keep a list of insights from each conversation in your journal.

# 4. Seek Guidance 
## A. Clarify Your Values
Do you want a career that brings stability? Creativity? Helping others? Recognition?

Your **career values** act as an inner compass. Here are some value prompts to reflect on:
- Do I want a job that allows me to work from anywhere?
- Is financial independence a top priority?
- Would I feel happiest working alone or in a team?
- Do I want to make a difference in people’s lives?

Your dream job isn’t just what you do—it’s how it fits into the life you want to build.

## B. Set Career Goals (Big and Small)
Break down the big question—“What do I want to be?”—into smaller, manageable goals.

Example:
- **Short-term goal:** Explore three new careers this month.
- **Mid-term goal:** Choose a subject stream based on my interests by next academic year.
- **Long-term goal:** Become a wildlife photographer or urban designer.

Setting goals keeps you focused, but also flexible. You don’t need all the answers now—but you need a direction.

📝 **Tip:** You can consider reaching out to an experienced career coach, they can help you think more clearly, structure your thoughts, and set meaningful goals.

Sometimes, a trained professional brings clarity when you're feeling confused, someone dedicated to guiding you with structure and support. That’s why coaching is a core part of our product at **Inwesol**.

# 5. Participate in Job Shadowing
Job shadowing means spending a day or two with a professional at their workplace.

It’s like a behind-the-scenes tour of a career. You’ll see what the job is really like—not just what people say it’s like.

Even shadowing for a few hours can answer key questions:
- Is this work exciting or repetitive?
- Does it involve a lot of people or solo work?
- Would I enjoy doing this every day?

📝 **Tip:** If you can’t shadow in-person, look for virtual job-shadowing videos on YouTube or LinkedIn Learning.

# 6. Join Career Workshops and Fairs
Career fairs and student workshops are full of energy, ideas, and inspiration.

These events let you:
- Explore multiple career fields in one place.
- Interact with mentors and professionals.
- Participate in fun activities that reveal your interests and aptitudes.

At **Inwesol**, we conduct workshops that help students experience self-discovery in a structured, engaging way, with career coaches and psychologists guiding the way.

📝 **Tip:** Attend events with a curious mind, not just to collect pamphlets.

# Conclusion: Your Career, Your Journey
Choosing a career isn’t a one-time decision. It’s a **journey of discovering who you are and where you want to go.** The more you understand your strengths, interests, and values, the better your choices will be, not just for college, but for life.

At **Inwesol**, we encourage students to start early, stay curious, and explore freely. It’s okay to change your mind. It’s okay to explore new things. What matters is that you’re **actively participating** in designing your future.

**Remember:** You don’t have to have all the answers today.
But by asking the right questions, you’re already on the right path.

    content: `**Career Motivation** refers to the drive that influences a person’s behaviour within the professional work environment. Think of career motivation like the GPS in a car. You might have the car (your skills), the road (opportunities) and the engine (your effort), but without the GPS, it’s easy to get lost. Your motivation sets the direction, keeps you focused when the road gets tough. Career motivation is what propels us toward specific occupations, strives for us to work diligently and seeks significance in our careers. This motivation is never purely about needing a salary check, it's rooted in our psychology and influences how we perceive ourselves and our position in the world.

![Career Motivation Dimension](/career-motivation-dim.jpg)

When you become seriously motivated in your career, you have higher job satisfaction, in the sense that you will enjoy the work rather than dreading Sunday nights and Monday mornings. This motivation translates into better productivity, as motivated individuals work harder at their projects and be more creative at solving problems (Westbrook et al., 2020). Most significantly, career motivation has a tremendous impact on our overall health and mental well-being.

When we are career motivated, our brains release chemicals like dopamine and serotonin that make us feel good and energize us. This is a healthy feedback loop in which achievement creates more motivation that then creates even more achievement (Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010; Fischer & Ullsperger, 2017). On the other hand, when we are not career motivated, we experience symptoms of depression like fatigue, cynicism and despair about the future (Bianchi et al., 2023).

Studies again and again identify that motivated workers are not only happier but also more creative, collaborative and better able to bounce back from failures. They're apt to do more than expected of them, accept learning experiences, and be a positive influence in their work environment. For adolescents anticipating their future, it's essential to study career motivation because it can help you make better choices regarding education, internships and future career choice. For parents, it can help you direct how you talk with your child regarding career choice, not only about what they will earn, but what will bring them happiness in the long term. Now let’s understand the types of motivation.

![Career Motivation Rewards](/career-motivation-rewards.jpg)

**Self-Determination Theory**, which was developed by psychologists Edward Deci and Richard Ryan, teaches us about two main types of motivation.

- **Intrinsic motivation** is from the inside out. It's the enjoyment you get from doing something because it's something you really enjoy doing, find interesting, or feel it's worth doing. An example would be a teenager who likes writing computer programs for video games. He or she is intrinsically motivated by computer programming.
- **Extrinsic motivation** is from external rewards or pressures, such as working for a lot of money, approval, or to escape punishment.

In Self-Determination Theory, three basic psychological needs motivate us:
1. Autonomy (being in charge of our choices)
2. Competence (feeling effective and able)
3. Relatedness (being connected to others)

When these needs are met in our work environment, we are more intrinsically motivated. For instance, a job where you get to choose how you will work (autonomy), stretches you just enough so you can build your skills (competence), and has healthy relationships with others (relatedness) will simply be more motivating.

Extrinsic rewards are vital and can serve as a motivator, but they work best as a complement to intrinsic satisfaction and not as the only source. With this knowledge, you can look beyond surface level career characteristics and study how different paths can meet your inner psychological needs.

## The Contribution of Intrinsic Motivation to Sustained Career Satisfaction

Intrinsic motivation is a sustainable fuel source for your career; it will not burn out like external rewards tend to. When you're intrinsically motivated, you're motivated by internal values, interest and the intrinsic satisfaction of the work itself. This is a highly stable basis for long term career excellence and satisfaction because you're not waiting around for someone else to get you pumped up with praise, promotions or raises.

A teenager who has an interest in the preservation of the environment may be deeply satisfied with a career in researching renewable energy, irrespective of pay prospects, because the profession is associated with their fundamental values. A person with innate talent for teaching and an interest in helping others is likely to be satisfied with teaching careers because the profession itself is satisfying.

The autonomy and competence aspects of Self Determination Theory come into play most here. When you have some control over how you do your work and feel confident in your ability to grow and learn, you are more likely to stay motivated even when things get challenging. Your intrinsic motivation grows strong too when you fail or encounter setbacks, your intrinsic motivation propels you forward instead of making you quit.

Intrinsic motivation becomes self reinforcing as well. If you enjoy what you are doing, you work harder at it naturally, which leads to better performance and greater competence. This competence creates new challenges and opportunities, which further engage your interest and participation. For parents and teenagers planning ahead, this translates to considering not only "What pays the most?" but "What would I truly be interested in and like to do for many years?" The goal is finding careers that energize rather than drain you in the long term.

## Balancing Extrinsic Rewards with Personal Purpose

Though intrinsic motivation is most important for long term happiness, eliminating extrinsic rewards altogether is unrealistic. We all need to pay bills, put food on the table and achieve financial security. The trick is finding the right balance and understanding how outside rewards can motivate or destroy our inner motivation. Research shows that when extrinsic rewards like money are the priority, they can actually suppress intrinsic motivation, a process known as the "overjustification effect” (Deci, 1971).

For example, if one picks an occupation solely for money without considering their values or interests, they might be initially motivated by the money. However, after some time, this motivation will wear off, leading to burnout, job dissatisfaction and a sense of emptiness. The money that was the central importance might not be sufficient to counteract the feeling of getting eight hours a day doing something that is nonsensical or against their values.

The best approach to sustainability is to use extrinsic rewards as secondary elements rather than the central foundation of career motivation. Look for careers with equitable pay and career opportunity as well as for value and interest alignment. For example, someone with an interest in helping other individuals might choose healthcare, social work, or nonprofit management careers that offer both meaningful work and equitable career prospects.

![Career Motivation Portfolio](/career-motivation-portfolio.jpg)

Think about creating a personal "motivation portfolio" with both intrinsic and extrinsic elements. Maybe 70% of job satisfaction comes from doing valuable work that you enjoy and 30% from extrinsic rewards like pay, benefits and perks. This proportion will also vary for different individuals and at different stages of life, but having knowledge of both kinds of motivation enables you to make wiser career decisions.

When parents and adolescents discuss career options, they should be asking questions like: "How can we seek out employment that is satisfying and well rewarding?". This two way answer ensures rewards from external sources are supplemented rather than replaced by intrinsic motivations and careers are realistically attainable and genuinely fulfilling.

Harnessing the power of both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation can transform not just your career,  your confidence. Are you driven by inner passion or external rewards? Maybe it’s both? It’s time to reflect, realign and rise. Tap into what fuels you from within, curiosity, growth or purpose and let external recognition or advancement be the wind in your sails. Take action now: set a goal that speaks to your values and back it with steps that move you toward personal and professional fulfillment. Your motivation, in all its forms, is your most valuable asset. Use it.

    content: `# What is Career Readiness?
If you’re a teenager planning for your future or a parent looking to guide your child toward the working world, you might be curious about what it takes to be prepared for a career. We call that as being career ready. So, what does it mean to be “career ready” and thrive in today’s job market?

Career readiness is defined as “a foundation from which to demonstrate requisite core competencies that broadly prepare the college educated for success in the workplace and lifelong career management” (NACE).These aren't just the specific skills you need for one particular job (like knowing how to code if you want to be a programmer), but the everyday skills that help you work well with others, solve problems and keep learning new things.

Think of career readiness as a bridge between school and the real world. In school, you learn facts and take tests. At work, you need to use what you've learned to solve real problems, work with different types of people and adapt when things change. Career readiness helps you make that jump effectively.

This is especially important for teenagers because the job market is changing faster than ever before. The jobs available when you graduate might be completely different from the ones that exist today. Preparing for multiple job types prepares you to explore different options and choose what is best for you by making informed decisions. It can result in growth, leading to a better financial future no matter what career path you choose.

#  Here’s How You Can Be Career Ready:

## 1. Building the Skills You'll Need

So what skills do you actually need to be career ready? Let's understand this in detail:
- **Communication Skills :** This might sound obvious, but being able to communicate well is important in any career. We're talking about being able to explain your ideas clearly, listen to others, write professional emails and even give presentations with more confidence. Whether you're talking to your boss, working with a team or helping a customer, good communication skills will make you stand out.
- **Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking :** Every job involves solving problems (it's part of working life). Maybe you need to organise an event, or a customer has a complaint, or your team needs to figure out how to finish a project on time. Being able to think through problems step by step, consider different solutions and make good decisions is incredibly valuable.
- **Technical Skills :** You don't need to be a computer genius, but you do need to be comfortable with technology. This means being able to learn new software quickly, understanding how to use digital tools to get your work done and staying up-to-date with new technology.

These assessments don’t give you a final answer, but they act like a mirror, reflecting your own interests and what feels natural and energising to you.

## 2. Getting Real-World Experience

Reading about work and actually doing it are two very different things. That's why getting some real-world experience while you're still in school is so valuable. You can read more about it in one of our blogs titled ["How to Choose A Career"](https://inwesol.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-career/) for some ways to do that.

## 3. Taking Care of Your Well-Being
Here's something that doesn't get talked about enough: taking care of your well being is a crucial part of being career ready. The working world can be stressful and learning how to manage that stress while you're young will help you throughout your career.

- **Managing Stress :** Whether it's dealing with difficult people, tight deadlines or just the general pressure of work, stress is part of having a job. Learning healthy ways to cope with stress like exercise, going to therapy, eating healthy, talking to friends, or taking breaks when you need them will help you stay productive and happy at work.
- **Finding Balance :** Work is important, but it's not everything. Learning how to balance work with the other things that matter to you (family, friends, hobbies) is a skill that will serve you well throughout your life.
- **Asking for Help :** Nobody expects you to figure everything out on your own. Being able to ask for help when you need it (whether it's from a coworker, your boss or an expert) is actually a sign of strength, not weakness.

![Career Readiness Challenges](/career-readiness-challenges.jpg)

## 4. Dealing with Challenges and Setbacks
Let's be honest: your career journey won't always be smooth. You might not get the first job you apply for, or you might realize that a career you thought you wanted isn't actually right for you. That's completely normal! The following things will help you be career ready:

- **Learning from Rejection :** Getting rejected for a job or internship stings, but it's also a learning opportunity. Ask for feedback, figure out what you can improve and keep trying. Every "no" gets you closer to a "yes."
- **Staying Motivated :** There will be times when you feel discouraged or unsure about your future. This is normal! Talk to people you trust, remember why you're working toward your goals and celebrate small victories along the way.
- **Keep Learning :** The most eminent people never stop learning. Whether it's taking a class, reading about your industry or just being curious about how things work, maintaining a learning mindset will help you stay relevant and engaged throughout your career.
- **Embracing Change :** The job market will continue to change throughout your career. Instead of being scared of change, try to see it as an opportunity to grow and try new things. The people who embrace change rather than resist it tend to excel.
- **Adaptability :** The ability to adapt with changes, learn new things quickly and stay positive when things don't go as planned will serve you well throughout your career. Jobs change, companies change and entire industries can transform. People who can adapt will always be in demand.

# Your Next Steps: Preparing for a Dynamic Future

Being career ready isn't about having everything figured out right now (it's about developing the skills and mindset that will help you excel no matter what path you choose). For parents, the best thing you can do is support your teenager's exploration of different career paths while helping them develop these fundamental skills. Encourage them to try new things, ask questions and learn from their experiences.

Remember, career readiness is a journey, not a destination. You don't need to have complete certainty. What matters is that you're taking steps to prepare yourself for whatever opportunities come your way.

## In the race to make machines more human, are we forgetting what it means to be human?

This question highlights a paradox in modern technology. Curiosity has always driven human progress from ancient Greece to today's AI era, we've consistently worked to replicate our physical and mental abilities through machines. We've achieved remarkable milestones in just 200 years of major technological revolutions and in the past 20 years alone, we've shifted entirely from analogue to digital. Now, we stand on the brink of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), marking perhaps the most significant milestone in human progress.

As we strive to duplicate our abilities, more and more of us have started to rely completely on these machines. What began as reducing physical strain has evolved into something far more profound. Today, with large language models and AI agents, even our thinking is being assigned to them. From calculators to computers to AI tools, machines have slowly taken over both physical and mental tasks.

The most concerning possibility? In trying to make AI more human, we may be turning humans into machines. People risk becoming less reflective and more reactive, losing the very essence of what makes us uniquely human.

At  Inwesol,  a team of psychologists, technologists & dreamers, we are focused on solving this. Rather than building another AI that replaces human abilities, we’re creating something revolutionary: an AI that helps you realize your own capabilities.

In a small high school, a student named Arnav always earned top grades. His teachers praised his perfect test scores, and his report card was full of A grades. Yet, outside the classroom, Arnav struggled. Group projects made him nervous, criticism hurt deeply and stress often overwhelmed him. His story, far from rare, reveals a key truth that grades alone don’t prepare students for life. Schools should teach and promote emotional intelligence, social skills, taking care of mental health, and creativity alongside academics to better prepare students for the future.

## The Limitations of Grades

Grades show only a small part of what a student can do. They measure how well someone memorizes facts or solves test problems, but they miss bigger skills. Researchers say that students’ focus on performing well to obtain good grades may then undermine their interest and 'love of learning' (Butler, 1987; Butler & Nisan, 1986; Jones, 2007; Pulfrey, Darnon, & Butera, 2013). This pressure can also increase anxiety and we see many teens feel stressed due to school demands. In real life, jobs value teamwork, adaptability and staying calm which typical school examinations don’t cover. Schools need to look beyond grades to help students succeed in the world.

![Factors support students-wellbeing](/blog-why-schools.jpg)

# Factors support Student Wellbeing

Let’s explore some factors that support students in real-world situations:

### **A. Emotional Intelligence:**

Emotional intelligence (EQ) means being aware, understanding and managing one’s emotions while connecting well with others. **Psychologist Daniel Goleman argues that EQ often matters more than IQ for success in life and work.** His theory emphasises that succeeding in both personal and professional spheres requires more than just cognitive abilities; it involves a deep understanding of one's own emotions and the skilful management of interpersonal relationships. A student who can handle stress or relate to friends is better equipped than one who’s only good at academics.

Schools can play a role in nurturing the EQ of children from a young age, in simple ways. Mindfulness activities help students notice their feelings, while group discussions build empathy.

### **B. Social Skills:**

Jobs today rely on teamwork. Whether in tech or healthcare, people need to communicate and collaborate. **Psychologist Lev Vygotsky’s social learning theory says we learn best when working with others.** Yet, many schools focus on solo tasks like tests instead of group skills. Schools can change this with group projects or peer mentoring, where students support each other.

### **C. Mental Health and Strength:**

More students face mental health challenges today. **Psychologist Ann Masten’s work on resilience shows that supportive places, like caring teachers and welcoming classrooms, help students recover from tough times. Carol Dweck’s growth mindset idea says teaching kids to see challenges as chances to grow makes them stronger.**

Schools can teach coping skills, like deep breathing or journaling. By supporting mental health, schools help students handle life’s ups and downs.

### **D. Creativity and Problem-Solving:**

The world changes fast, and creativity is crucial. **Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s work demonstrates that the most creative breakthroughs often happen when people are in a state of flow, fully immersed in their work, driven by curiosity and joy rather than external rewards.** But many schools skip arts or open-ended projects for test prep. Adding music, drama, or problem-solving activities can spark students’ imaginations.

# Practical 7 Steps for Schools

Schools can move beyond focusing only on grades by introducing life skills classes such as managing emotions or budgeting. Teachers should be trained to nurture students’ emotional and social development and build a classroom culture rooted in a Learning Mindset. Tests can also include group projects, while parents should also be educated on the value of these skills to help support and reinforce the change.

### **1. Integrate Life Skills into the Curriculum:**

Schools should embed lessons on emotional regulation, communication, and practical life skills within existing subjects. For instance, literature classes can explore characters’ emotions to teach empathy, while mathematics can include budgeting exercises to promote financial literacy.

### **2. Train Teachers to Support Holistic Growth:**

Educators require professional development to address students’ emotional and social needs effectively. Workshops on recognizing signs of stress or fostering a growth mindset, as outlined by psychologist Carol Dweck, can empower teachers to create supportive classrooms. Schools can access online training modules from organizations like the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence

### **3. Reform Assessment Systems:**

Traditional grading often prioritizes test performance over broader skills. Schools should incorporate alternative assessments, such as reflective journals, group project evaluations, or portfolios showcasing creative work. Schools can pilot these systems in one subject before scaling up, minimizing disruption.

### **4. Create Safe Spaces for Mental Health:**

Schools must provide environments where students feel safe to express emotions. This can include designated “calm corners” for mindfulness exercises or access to school counselors trained in resilience strategies. Schools can partner with local mental health organizations to offer free workshops and resources.

### **5. Foster Collaborative Learning:**

Group projects and peer mentoring programs build social skills, which highlight learning through interaction. Schools can implement structured group activities, such as community service projects, to teach teamwork. For example, a school might organize a student-led recycling initiative, fostering leadership and collaboration. 

### **6. Engage Parents and the Community:**

Parents must understand the value of non-academic skills to reinforce them at home. Schools can host workshops or send newsletters explaining how emotional intelligence and resilience benefit students. Community partnerships, such as with local arts organizations for creative programs, can expand resources. 

### **7. Promote Extracurricular Opportunities:**

Clubs, sports, and arts programs provide natural settings for developing creativity and social skills. Schools can offer low-cost options, like after-school drama or debate clubs, to ensure accessibility.

# Conclusion

When schools teach beyond grades, students like Arnav thrive. They gain tools to navigate life’s challenges, from job interviews to personal setbacks. Schools that act now create adults who are not just smart but adaptable, kind, and creative.

Schools, educators, parents, and policymakers must come together to redefine educational excellence. They should advocate for curricula that nurture the whole student, implement teacher training, and embrace alternative assessments. Together, they can build an education system that empowers every student with a Learning Mindset to face the future with confidence and capability.
