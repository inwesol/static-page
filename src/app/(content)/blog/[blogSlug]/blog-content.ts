# What is Career Guidance?

Career guidance is a process where trained professionals help individuals identify their strengths and interests through self-assessments, enabling them to make informed career decisions.

## In a nutshell, Career guidance focuses on

- Identifying individual interests.

# A Brief History of Career Guidance

The concept of career guidance is not new, it has been around for over a century. Let&apos;s take a look at how it started and evolved!

- **Early 1900s:** Career guidance emerged during the World Wars when returning veterans and displaced workers struggled to reintegrate into civilian life. To address this, governments and organizations developed vocational programs, paving the way for modern career counselling. Frank Parsons, known as the "father of vocational guidance," introduced a structured approach to career decision-making based on:
  - Self-assessments (Personality, Vocational Interests and Preferences)
  - Labour market trends (Understanding occupations & required skills)
- **Mid-20th Century:** Career counselling expanded into educational institutions, helping students align their interests with growing job opportunities.
- **Present Day:** With advancements in psychology, technology, **career guidance assessment tests**, personalized coaching, and AI-driven tools, **career guidance and counselling** blend traditional expertise with modern tools to ensure personalized career support.

# Why is Career Guidance Important? How does it matter?

### **Myth #1: Career Guidance is Only for Students**
**Reality:** While **career guidance for students** is essential, career planning is a lifelong process. Professionals at any stage can benefit from expert guidance.

### **Myth #2: A Career Guidance Assessment Test Predicts Your Future**

# Career Coaching vs Career Counselling:

Your career journey is ever growing and ongoing etc whether you&apos;re a student exploring possibilities or a professional striving for the next milestone. Choosing the right guidance can make all the difference. Understanding the distinction between career counseling and career coaching helps you make informed decisions that shape your future. In this blog, we&apos;ll explore their origins, key differences, and how choosing the right support can significantly impact your career trajectory.

# Origins of Counselling

The [roots](https://www.newyorkbehavioralhealth.com/history-of-mental-health-counseling-part-i/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) of counselling can be traced back to the early 20th century. Frank Parsons, often hailed as the "father of vocational guidance," established the Bureau of Vocational Guidance in Boston. His mission was to assist individuals in aligning their personal traits with suitable careers. This pioneering work laid the foundation for modern **career counselling** practices and continues to influence how we approach career guidance today.

As the field evolved, traditional **career counselling online** began offering accessible and empathetic support, making it easier for individuals from all backgrounds to explore their options and make decisions about their futures.

# The Rise of Coaching

In contrast to the early days of counselling, [coaching](http://thetimes.co.uk/) emerged as a distinct profession in the latter half of the 20th century. Drawing inspiration from sports and business, coaching focuses on enhancing performance and realizing capability . The development of models such as the GROW model in 1986 exemplifies the structured approach that **Career coaching brings** to personal and professional development.

This evolution has also given rise to **personal and professional coaching** methods that empower individuals to set clear goals, overcome challenges, and achieve significant milestones. With a proactive and action-oriented mindset, career coaching emphasizes forward movement, making it an essential tool for those who want to take charge of their professional lives.

# Understanding Career Counselling

**Career counselling** is designed to provide guidance by helping you understand and navigate your career options. This process often includes assessments to evaluate your interests, skills, and values, advising you toward a career path that aligns with who you are. Whether you&apos;re considering a new field or trying to clarify your current direction, **career counselling online** platforms offer insights and support tailored to your unique situation.

By connecting with a career counsellor, you can expect a compassionate, clear, and inclusive approach that not only illuminates your strengths but also helps you envision a fulfilling future.

# The Power of Career Coaching

On the other hand, **Career coaching** is a dynamic, collaborative process focused on empowering you to achieve specific professional goals. Unlike the reflective nature of counselling, coaching is action-oriented—geared toward setting objectives, developing strategies, and building essential skills such as leadership, communication, and resilience.

A career coach works with you to break down long-term goals into manageable steps, fostering both skill development and self-confidence. Through regular check-ins and strategic planning, **Career coaching** helps you stay motivated and accountable as you navigate the evolving job market. This approach not only encourages growth but also cultivates a sense of community and connection, as you&apos;re guided by professionals who understand your challenges and are eager to help you succeed.

# Key Differences and Their Impact

## Focus and Approach

- **Career Counselling:** Emphasizes understanding your personal interests, values, and skills to identify career paths. This process is often reflective and analytical, designed to decide which direction to choose.
- **Career Coaching:** Is future-focused and action-oriented, prioritizing goal setting and the development of strategies to overcome specific challenges. It is designed to drive progress and encourage continuous improvement and helps you identify the suitable career.

## Duration and Outcome

- **Career Counselling:** Typically involves a shorter, more focused engagement aimed at providing clarity and suggesting you to make decisions. Whether you opt for face-to-face sessions or **career counselling online**, the goal is to set a solid foundation for your professional journey.
- **Career Coaching:** Often represents a longer-term commitment. As you work together with your coach, you receive ongoing support and accountability, ensuring that your strategies adapt to a changing job market and that your growth is sustained over time.

## Action-Oriented Growth

The beauty of **Career coaching** lies in its ability to inspire action. By focusing on tangible steps and measurable outcomes, coaching not only improves your professional skills but also boosts your confidence. This dynamic approach can be especially beneficial in today&apos;s fast-paced world, where adapting quickly and maintaining momentum are key to long-term success.

# Bringing It All Together

Whether you choose **career counselling online** for its accessibility or decide that the structured, ongoing support of **Career coaching** is the right fit for you, remember that both pathways are designed to empower you. Embrace the guidance available, take confident steps toward your dreams, and join a community committed to helping you realize your full capability.

Purpose is an active commitment to accomplish an aim that is both meaningful to the self and of consequence to the world beyond the self. 

Have you ever felt like you're working hard but still feel disconnected from what you do? Or maybe you've switched careers, chased better salaries, or followed the path everyone recommended, yet something still feels off. That “something” could be the missing piece , your “why”. 

When you discover your purpose \- your reason for doing what you do, your career takes a different shape. It becomes something that energizes you, aligns with your values, and offers more than just a paycheck. It gives you direction, resilience, and clarity.

This is the core of career wellbeing

# So, What Is Career Wellbeing?

Career Well Being refers to the fulfillment individuals feel in their everyday work. It is at its peak when their work aligns with their strengths, offers a sense of purpose, and keeps them deeply engaged.

According to Gallup, career wellbeing is one of the five essential elements of overall well being, and it influences everything from your mental health to your physical health and even your relationships. When people experience purpose at work, research shows they are more engaged, more productive, and even healthier.

# How Do You Know Your ‘Why’?

For many of us, discovering our ‘why’ doesn’t happen overnight. It’s often a journey. There are a few different ways people tend to find their sense of purpose:

1\. **Proactive Exploration**    
Some people actively seek it. They reflect on their strengths, explore their interests, and ask themselves meaningful questions about what they want to contribute to the world. This kind of self-discovery is an intentional and reflective process.

2\. **Reactive Moments**    
For others, purpose emerges from experiences, sometimes difficult ones. A setback, a life-changing event, or even dissatisfaction with a current career path might lead to deep self-questioning, which sparks the need for change.

3\. **Social Learning**    
Sometimes, purpose is shaped by our surroundings. Role models, communities, or causes we care about can influence what we choose to pursue. The values of people around us often shape our own.

Let’s see some stories on.. How Purpose Drove Individuals Towards Excellence

### **Story #1: The Dancer Who Refused to Stop**

Sudha Chandran, She started dancing at the age of three, and it wasn’t just a hobby, it was her identity. Despite societal pressure to follow a “safe” path, she followed her passion. But at sixteen, she met with a terrible accident that resulted in the loss of a leg. For most, that would have been the end of the story, but not for her. With a Jaipur foot and unshakable belief, she learned to dance again. She performed on national stages and starred in films. Her purpose gave her strength and a reason to rise again.This story is the best example of how both proactive efforts and reactive moments came together to shape her purpose.

### **Story #2: The Inventor Who Changed His Village**

Mallesham, a young man from a rural village, watched his mother suffer daily due to the tedious hand-weaving process. Her pain moved him deeply. Without any technical background, he set out to build a machine that could ease her work. Everyone doubted him. But he persisted, working for years to build what later became the **Lakshmi Asu machine**. His invention revolutionized traditional weaving and earned him national recognition. His story shows how empathy sparked his purpose, and how both reactive moments and proactive efforts helped him create a machine that truly made a difference. 

### **Story #3: Murlikant Petkar** 

India’s first Paralympic gold medalist, Murlikant Petkar was once a soldier who was severely injured during the 1965 war. Despite the physical challenges, he didn’t stop. He turned to swimming and eventually represented India, winning a gold medal in the 1972 paralympics. Even before his injury, he had a strong inclination toward sports, from wrestling at a young age to becoming a boxer in the army and winning a silver medal in Tokyo, Petkar consistently pursued **excellence**. He was always in search of becoming the **best version of himself**, driven by curiosity, discipline, and a deep love for sport. This proactive journey shows how purpose can be self-driven,  shaped by one’s own choices, values, and efforts to contribute meaningfully to the world. 

These are just a few examples. Each story is different, yet one thing connects them , a strong sense of purpose.

When your career aligns with your purpose, it creates:

1\. **Clarity:** You know what you’re working toward and why it matters.    
2\. **Perseverance**: Continued effort to do or achieve something despite difficulties or failures.    
3\. **Resilience**: The ability to bounce back from setbacks.    
4\. **Improved mental health and career wellbeing**: You feel more fulfilled, less stressed, and more confident about your choices.

Here’s how a coach 🔗 [link to free session](https://www.inwesol.com/events/cohort/) can help you connect with what truly matters to you?

Many times, we get stuck because we haven’t paused to reflect. We chase jobs, promotions, or trends, but forget to ask what really matters to us. That’s where coaching helps. With the right coach, you gain a safe space to explore your values, interests, and goals. You start recognizing patterns in your choices, understanding your strengths, and gradually finding clarity about your next steps. Whether you're just starting out, switching careers, or feeling lost in the noise, discovering your why can help you move forward with confidence.
